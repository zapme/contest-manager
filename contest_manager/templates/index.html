        <p>Pleasant greetings to you, OM. Welcome to the WY4RC Contest Manager.</p>
        <p>On this page you will find amateur radio contests that are currently made available on here,
            whether ongoing, past, or in the future. Where available, rules, results and log submissions can be found
            in the individual pages of contests, which you may elect to examine at the pleasure of your mouse click.</p>
        <p>For logistics pertaining to a particular contest, please raise the matter with the contest organizer
            directly. This program is highly experimental. If you experience any difficulties using the site, please
            get in touch using the links at the footer.
        </p>
        <p>From all of the YARC Contest Manager developers, we wish you great fun on the airwaves.</p>
